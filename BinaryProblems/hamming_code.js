Problem: Error Correction in Binary Data (Hamming Code Simulation)
Given two binary strings a and b, design a function that performs 
binary addition with error detection and correction using 
Hamming Code principles.

Input:  Binary strings a and b.
Output: Corrected binary sum with error detection.

Example:
Input:
a = "1011001"
b = "0110010"

Output:
"10001111"
(Includes correction bits for error detection.)
